# ML Data & Models
# Usually we DON'T want to commit large CSVs, but for this demo maybe keep them? 
# The user wants "Push it to github", assuming they want the data too for reproducibility?
# I'll exclude large models if they were huge, but these are small pickles.
# I will exclude the data folder if it's large, but train.csv is small.
# I'll leave data/ included for this homework-style task.
